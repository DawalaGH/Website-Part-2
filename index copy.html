    Pizza (Italian:['pittsa'], Neapolitan:['pittsa']) is a savory dish of Italian origin
    consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with
    tomatoes, cheese, and other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms,
    onions, olives, pineapples, meat, etc), which is then baked at a high temperature,
    traditionally in wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzeta. A
    person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.
